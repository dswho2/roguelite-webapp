# Roguelite Web App

This project is a browser-based 2D turn-based dungeon crawler built using Phaser for rendering, React and Redux for UI and state management, and TypeScrip* for strong type safety. The frontend is styled with Tailwind CSS and bundled using Vite for fast development. Game logic includes modular systems for inventory, combat, and exploration, and is designed to support expandable content such as procedurally generated levels and AI-driven enemy behavior. Will be deployed on vercel.

- Dynamic inventory and gear management
- Turn-based combat system with visual feedback
